# 👋 Hi, I'm Beckham Benny Ross

Welcome to my GitHub workspace! I’m a robotics and systems engineering student with a focus on autonomous systems, ROS (Robot Operating System), and real-world applications of mobile robotics.

## 🔧 About Me

- 🎓 Engineering student with a focus on **robotics** and **systems engineering**
- 🤖 Currently working on **autonomous navigation** using **AgileX LIMO** and **ROS 1 Melodic**
- 🛠️ Interested in **robotics software development**, **sensor integration**, and **system-level thinking**

## 📌 Featured Project

### 🔷 LIMO Autonomous Navigation

This project applies a **systems engineering approach** to develop an autonomous navigation system for the AgileX LIMO robot using **ROS 1 Melodic**. It includes:

- Custom-designed test arena based on the theme *"Jewel Canopy Park"*
- ROS configuration for mapping, localization, and path planning
- Hands-on integration and testing on the physical robot
