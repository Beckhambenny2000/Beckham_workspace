Hi, I'm Beckham Benny Ross
Welcome to my GitHub workspace!

I'm an engineering student with a strong interest in robotics and systems engineering. My current focus is on autonomous navigation using the AgileX LIMO mobile robot and ROS 1 Melodic. I focus on solving integration challenges in robotics through a structured systems approach.

Current Project – LIMO Autonomous Navigation
This project applies a systems engineering methodology to develop and test an autonomous navigation system for the AgileX LIMO robot. My team and I created a custom indoor arena based on the theme “Jewel Canopy Park” to serve as a structured test environment. The robot was configured with ROS 1 packages for mapping, localization, and path planning. The project emphasizes real-world testing and system-level integration.

Skills and Tools

Programming: Python, C++

Robotics Framework: ROS 1 (Melodic)

Tools: RViz, Gazebo, Ubuntu, Git

Key Areas: SLAM, path planning, sensor integration, systems approach

Currently Learning

ROS Melodic

AI applications in robotics

Advanced system modeling and simulation

Feel free to explore my repositories and projects. I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, or just connecting with others interested in robotics and systems engineering!
